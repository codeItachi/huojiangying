        <div>Hei Yiyang(born in 1975 in Henan Province ) is one of the most active artistic and cultural exchange pioneers in China. He devotes himself to putting different mediums like design, contemporary art, advertising, architectural space, city, society together, to make the works interesting, meaningful and valuable. </div>
        <div style="margin:33px 0 0 0">Hei Yiyang prefers investigating the phenomena of sociology instead of impersonating it. Carring on their legacy, re-contextualizing art practice into cultural and political atmospheres constitutes the early focus of Hei’ artistic explorously. For a long period of time the artist recorded sociology with a restrained attitude, aiming to substitute Multi-dimensional thinking and subvert traditional art concepts for rational presentations. Hei Yiyang tends to interpretate an artistic kind of science, a poetic logic.</div>
        <div style="margin:33px 0 0 0">Behind each project is an extensive process of research, involving a mapping of the process through a series of collage and photography. His collage, installation, video and documentary touch upon the recurring topics of social phenomenon, conflict, humanity, time and national frontiers. Key to Hei’s interest in conflict is its interplay with time. Eventually presents the contemporary social and cultural analysis from an artist’s view.</div>
